Welcome to this NHP online tool.

This tool is designed to help facilitate a demand and capacity modelling process to support the development of robust, local NHP proposals.

The New Hospital Programme requires estimates of future activity levels to inform the design of a new hospital.
This tool is designed to help determine how hospital activity might change in the years to come (relative to a baseline year) and to provide a high-level view of the physical capacity required to meet that demand.

For more information or help, please visit the [model information site](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/) or contact the [MLCSU NHP Analytics mailbox](mailto:mlcsu.nhpanalytics@nhs.net).
